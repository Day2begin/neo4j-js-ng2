- Annoying bugs and annoying features fixed from v1.

**New features**

- Links details are no editable.
- Links can be created in the create mode.

## Getting started

- Clone or download the project
- Rename `neo4j.settings.json.dist` into `neo4j.settings.json`.
- Run `ng serve` or `npm start`.

### Pre-requisites

- Neo4j must be installed [Neo4j quick install instructions here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-neo4j-on-an-ubuntu-vps)
- Neo4j Basic Authentication must have been configured (by default)
- Angular2 CLI is required for running with `ng serve` or building into the `dist` folder.

### Quick configuration

- With Angular2: serve projeect with `ng serve`and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`
- Without Angular2: create a virtual host on your machine and point it to the `dist` folder
- Copy `src/assets/neo4j.settings.json.dist` to `neo4j.settings.json` and change with your settings
- Change client `authBasic` value to `Basic: <authString>`. Auth string is a base64 encode of neo4j `username:password`


## Graph events

@todo

## Running in production

Clone the repository and point an Apache2 or Nginx virtual host to the `./dist` folder (see `./support` files for examples).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Known issues

- Chrome:  **Compatibility OK** (no known issues)
- In Firefox local storage is not shared between tabs so you might experience settings or debug logs inconsistent views.
- There is a bug in Firefox when you create relationships between nodes. The dragline randomly stays stuck on the node (1/2 times).

## Licence

You do absolutely what you want with that project (MIT Licence).
